# Vim: A sense of project

## Introduction
Vim (or [Neovim](https://neovim.io/)) is an awesome text editor, it is
lightweight, ubiquitous and customizable in its core, but those are secondary
traits, what makes Vim shine are its fast-writing capabilities with powerful
keyboard-centered composable commands.

Despite its benefits, there is a large list of things which Vim can't do like:
- Advanced file management
- GIT integration
- Code completion
- Code linting
- Pairing sessions
- Global find and replace

All of those are indispensable tools for everyday development, but is this
true? Not at all, and I'll show you how you can create a better Vim setup so
you can access the tools that you value the most and without losing the power
of Vim.

## Disclaimer
This is not a total-beginners guide to Vim, if you have previously configured
Vim then you are good to go.

## Body
Vim's built-in customizability allows the community to create plugins for it,
and [VimAwesome](https://vimawesome.com/) is the Hub for almost all public
plugins available, check it out, as its name suggest, it is awesome (you can
navigate with the Vim keys).

Adding plugins to Vim is straightforward:
 1. Download it
 1. Add it on your config file (.vimrc or init.vim) by sourcing it
 1. Source again your config file or close/open Vim
 1. Enjoy!

Even though it is not hard to do it, it is tedious, so I recommend you to
use a Plugin manager like [Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) or
[Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim), I recommend Plug because is
the one I have used.

### File management

#### netrw
Vim comes out of the box with a file explorer named **netrw**, in order to use
it you can enter `:Exp` or `:Explorer` on normal mode. It will show a list of
files in the current directory (you can navigate them with the usual keys), if
you open a file and want to get back to the file explorer, you can use `:Rex`
in normal mode.

![netrw open file](images/netrw_open_file.gif)

It seems that you can't create new files or directories from it. That's because
it is such an obscure tool to use. Use `:help Explore` or press `F1` on the
explore screen to see the full list of commands.

For example, in order to create a new file, use the `%` key; this will prompt
you to name a new file in the current directory.

![netrw new file](images/netrw_new_file.gif)

You can sort the explorer entries, open them on split or on another tab, hide
dot-files, show/hide files with custom filters, create bookmarks, execute
arbitrary commands to marked files and a few other interesting commands.

#### NERDTree
If you happen to love the way trees present your project's files, you may be
better with the [NERDTree](https://vimawesome.com/plugin/nerdtree-red) plugin,
a powerful tool for file management.

NERDTree allows a lot of plugins to enhance its capabilities, I'll show you a
few of them later on.

![NERDTree new file](images/nerd_tree_new_file.gif)

You can create a shortcut to fast-toggle the NERDTree, in your config file:

```vim
" By default, your leader is the \ key
nnoremap <leader>f :NERDTreeToggle<CR>
```

Also, you can see the plugin documentation pressing `?` when NERDTree is open.

#### FZF
And what about searching for files by their name or contents? Here comes
[FZF](https://vimawesome.com/plugin/fzf), it allows you to use the FZF tool
for fuzzy file searching, and on top of that, it allows you to use any other
searcher like 'git grep', ripgrep or the silversearcher (I use the ripgrep
tool).

![FZF open file](images/fzf_ctrl_p.gif)

 You can create a shortcut the same way as on the well-known **ctrlp** finder,
 for doing so, you need to map the FZF plugin to the `ctrl-p` shortcut (and/or
 configure FZF to use ripgrep as its default command):

```vim
noremap <c-p> :FZF<CR>

" Fuzzy finder configuration to use the ripgrep tool
let $FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND = 'rg --files --hidden'
```

You can use the `Rg` tool to search for file contents. 

![FZF open file by content](images/fzf_ctrl_s.gif)

You can map that command to ctrl-s:
```vim
noremap <c-s> :Rg<CR>
```

### Project-wide find and replace
This may be the hardest thing to achieve in Vim without feeling that you did
something that you shouldn't have. There are a lot of ways of doing this, I'll
present you the easiest one (though, not the best).

By default, Vim comes with `:grep` and `:vimgrep`, they both allow you to
filter files by their content and save that list in the `quickfist` list.
Once filtered, you can make replacements in only in those files by using the
`:cfdo` command, for example to find and replace the function named
`read_file`:
  1. First you configure Vim's hidden feature `:set hidden` to allow you to
  edit files without errors for not having saved them.
  1. This is not needed, but makes the process faster by only processing the
  required files (select only ruby files with `read_file` in them)
  `:grep -r read_file *.rb`
  1. And finally replacing them with `:cfdo %s/read_file/read/gc | update`

![Vim Find and Replace](images/find_and_replace.gif)

This method uses the unix's `grep` tool and won't omit files that you may no
want to use like `node_modules` or ignored files by your source control system
for Javascript, I'll leave a couple of interesting posts at the end of this one
so you can read more about this find-and-replace stuff.

### Project workspace
You close Vim and call it a day, next morning when you open the editor you
probably have forgotten which files you were working on and how you arranged
them. Well you don't have to go through that hassle no more, Vim has sessions
that allow you to save your workplace as you left them the last time.

In normal, mode enter `:mksession` to create a new session file in your working
directory called `Session.vim`, if you want to open Vim with that specific
session only open Vim with the `-S` flag and you are set.

![Vim Session](images/session.gif)

The downside of using sessions is that you have to override them every time you
have to change your workspace layout or open files, to overcome this issue, you
can use [Obsession](https://vimawesome.com/plugin/obsession-vim) to manage all
session-related stuff for you.

Remember to always start Vim with `vim -S` to use your `Session.vim` file.

### Code Completion
By default Vim can complete based on dictionaries, opened buffers and tags
files, this can fall short compared to other text editors.

Also, this is a controversial subject for Vim users, there is no unanimous
verdict on what a completion tool should or shouldn't do, I'll list a couple of
plugins for code completion:

  - [COC](https://vimawesome.com/plugin/coc-nvim) has support
  for a lot of languages, function signature completion and a handful of
  extensions.
  - [youcompleteme](https://vimawesome.com/plugin/youcompleteme) has a lot of
  search engines for different languages.
  - [Supertab](https://vimawesome.com/plugin/supertab) allows you to use the
  complete tool using the `tab` key.

### Code linters
There are a bunch of useful plugins for code linting, but the following two are
my picks:

  - [Ale](https://vimawesome.com/plugin/ale)
  - [Neomake](https://vimawesome.com/plugin/neomake-impatience-and-laziness)

Whichever plugin you want to use will work (I use Neomake).

### Code navigation
If you want to go directly to a function declaration, Vim has built-in support
for it. Vim takes advantage of the `tags` file, you need a tool to generate
that file. The downside of it is that you have to update that file every time
you make a significant change on your codebase, to avoid that boring process,
use [Gutentags](https://vimawesome.com/plugin/vim-gutentags), which handles all
the tags-related tasks.

To go to a code declaration, position the cursor on the specific method or
class name and use `ctrl + ]`, if there's a tags file with that definition, it
will move you directly to its declaration.

![Tags](images/tags.gif)

### Code snippets
I don't use snippets, but if you do, there are a lot of plugins for it, the
most known and used is the
[Snipmate & Nltisnip Snippets](https://vimawesome.com/plugin/vim-snippets)
plugin.

Also, for commenting code, you can use the
[NERD Commenter](https://vimawesome.com/plugin/the-nerd-commenter) plugin.

### Pairing sessions
Vim by itself doesn't have remote pairing capabilities, but it can be achieved
with [tmate](https://tmate.io) for fast SSH session creation with read-only
capabilities (uses your Tmux configuration if you already have it).

### GIT integration
Since you can execute arbitrary commands in Vim, you can communicate with GIT,
but that is not that fun, there are a couple of plugins to enhance the
GIT capabilities inside Vim:

  - [NERDTree Git Plugin](https://vimawesome.com/plugin/nerdtree-git-plugin)
  shows visual elements to your NERDTree so you know that something is going on
  with them
  - [Vim Gutter](https://vimawesome.com/plugin/vim-gitgutter) uses the status
  column to show new, edited and deleted lines in your open buffers, show
  differences, etc.
  - [Fugitive](https://vimawesome.com/plugin/fugitive-vim) to call any GIT
  command inside VIm, with amazing diff, log and blame capabilities.

### Spelling and Dictionary
Vim has built-in capabilities for spell-checking, highlighting and correction,
in order to enable them in normal mode enter `:set spell spelllang=en_us`.

![Vim Spelling](images/spelling_check.gif)

Vim also has built-in Dictionary completion, to use it, your system should have
a **words** file, in Linux by default there's a dictionary file at
`/usr/share/dict/words` (you can download them), in normal mode enter
`:set dictionary+=/usr/share/dict/words` to append it to existing dictionaries

![Vim Dictionary](images/dictionary_complete.gif)

Use `ctrl + x` and `ctrl + k` to open the completion modal, use the `ctrl + p`
and `ctrl + n` shortcuts to navigate it.

### Large file editing
Vim tends to choke when you open large files due to all the line numeration,
syntax highlighting and all the plugins working on that specific file, for
editing that specific file, you can disable the aforementioned tools and then
edit the file, or use the [LargeFile](https://vimawesome.com/plugin/largefile)
plugin to do it for you.

## Conclusion
All of this seems like a lot, why should I even care to do all of this if
Visual Studio Code, or "Insert my favorite code editor" does that and more
right out of the box? You may ask, well the thing here is that it allows you to
tailor the text editor as you please, without major shortcomings, faster than
any other code editor you have ever use, ready to be used in almost any Unix
system that you come across (and windows too).

For me, it is **the experience**, that rewarding feeling that you get when you
happen to do a tedious thing with a couple of commands; tools make the
work experience, I'm sure that woodworkers don't like a dull saw nor
painters like cheap brushes.
